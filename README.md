# RaceTrackGame_game
Create a simple game where you navigate a circle around some obstacles. 

You will need to download Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and install the .NET framework from the extension list. If you do not see this listed as an available download, simply follow the directions below, run the script and it should automatically begin an install for you. Alright, so lets get to it. With help from a GPT model, I asked GPT to create for me a game. I gave it a series of instructions on what I wanted and I let it run. This was a great way for me to test how a specific and more defined model can create some really cool results. The more information you provide, the better the results. This is just a simple implementation for a terminal game and you can even extend it to add more features like increasing the difficulty by adjusting the number of obstacles or modifying the track layout. Just open the Program.cs file and tweak the code to your liking. My steps below will hopefully show you how to create your own version of this game. I created this on my Mac, however, these instructions should work for both Mac and Windows. See the FAQ page for resolutions to some problems I ran into that you may as well. 

1. Ensure you have VS Code open to the main Welcome screen and then open the terminal window and type the following:

   dotnet new console -n RaceTrackGame

   This will create a new file on your system where the solution will run. 

2. Next, type the following into the terminal:

   open RaceTrackGame

   If you have VS Code open, then it should automatically open the Program.cs file in VS Code. 

3. Replace all the code here with the code that is attached to this repository named csharp_script. Then, save the file. 

4. Open the terminal again and type in the following:

   cd RaceTrackGame
   dotnet run

   This should then lauch the game within the terminal window where you can play with the arrow keys on your keyboard. Enjoy!
