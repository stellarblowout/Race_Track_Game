# RaceTrackGame_game
Create a simple game where you navigate a circle around some obstacles. 

You will need to download Visual Studio Code and install the .NET framework from the extension list. If you do not see this listed as an available download, simply follow the directions below, run the script and it shoukd automatically install for you. This is just a simple implementation for a terminal game and you can always extend it to add more features like increasing the difficulty by adjusting the number of obstacles or modifying the track layout. Just open the Program.cs file and change the code a little. Just use the steps below to create your own version of this game. I created this on my Mac, however, these instructions should work for both Mac and Windows. See the FAQ page for resolutions to some problems I ran into that you may as well. 

1. Open the terminal and type the following:

   dotnet new console -n RaceTrackGame

   This will create a new file where the solution will run. 

2. Go back to the terminal and type the following:

   open RaceTrackGame

   This should open the Program.cs file in Visual Studio Code. 

3. Replace all the code here with the code that is attached to this repository named csharp_script. Then, save the file. 

4. Open the terminal again and type in the following:

   cd RaceTrackGame
   dotnet run

   This should then lauch the game within the terminal window where you can play with the arrow keys on your keyboard.
