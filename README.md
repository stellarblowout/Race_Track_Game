# RaceTrackGame_game
Create a simple game where you navigate a circle around some obstacles. 

This is a simple implementation for a terminal game and you can always extend it to add more features. You can increase the difficulty by adjusting the number of obstacles or modifying the track layout. Just open the Program.cs file and change the code a little. Just use the steps below to create your own version of this game. 

1. Open the terminal and type the following:

dotnet new console -n RaceTrackGame

This will create a new file where the solution will run. 

2. Go back to the terminal and type the following:

open RaceTrackGame

This should open the Program.cs file in Visual Studio Code. 

3. Replace all the code here with the code that is attached to this repository named csharp_code. Then, save the file. 

4. Open the terminal again and type in the following:

cd RaceTrackGame
dotnet run

This should then lauch the game within the terminal window where you can play with the arrow keys on your keyboard.
