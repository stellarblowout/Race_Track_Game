Q: I got an error in the terminal when I ran the program. 

A: If you get an error from the terminal window, check the error code to see if it indicates which line of code needs to be changed/removed. For instance, there was an issue with window sizing on line 19. Removing the associated code with the error should alleviate the issue/s. You may encounter the error I originally received, which was from the following two lines:

   Console.SetWindowSize(screenWidth, screenHeight);
   Console.SetBufferSize(screenWidth, screenHeight);
